# Mesh-Generator-For-Unity
Mesh Generation in Unity was always been a challenging task in Unity. Especially triangulation algorithm implementation is not an easy part.

# Description
To overcome the challenges of mesh generation in unity, I learnt and implemented a mesh generation procedure that will create a mesh with n vertices. The thickness of the mesh can be given to specify the thickness of the mesh.
